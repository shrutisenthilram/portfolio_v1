        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm a Computer Science and Business Economics student at UC San Diego, minoring in Design. I’ve always been the kind of person who loves building things, not just for the sake of creating, but to connect people, solve problems, and make experiences better.

I thrive where technology, design, and collaboration meet. Whether I’m prototyping an app, organizing events through Design Co or exploring the world of quantitative finance, I’m constantly seeking opportunities to bridge creativity with logic. 

Some of my favorite projects have been team efforts, and I’ve learned that while solo work builds skill, teamwork builds possibility.

Outside of academics, you’ll probably find me at the gym, sketching ideas, looking for something new to learn or getting lost in conversations about just about anything. I love surrounding myself with passionate people and being part of communities where everyone pushes each other to grow, and supports each other in their growth.

Right now, I’m focused on: 

Mastering full-stack development and app design

Exploring the overlap between software engineering and finance

Building products that are both functional and beautiful
